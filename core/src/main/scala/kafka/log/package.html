    Kafka 最核心的日志结构代码，包括日志、日志段、索引文件等，该包下封装了 Log Compaction 的实现机制。
    很多其他的核心组件都是以日志为基础，比如状态管理机和副本管理器等。

The log management system for Kafka.

The entry point for this system is LogManager. LogManager is responsible for holding all the logs, and handing them out by topic/partition. It also handles the enforcement of the
flush policy and retention policies.

The Log itself is made up of log segments. A log is a FileRecords that contains the data and an OffsetIndex that supports reads by offset on the log.
